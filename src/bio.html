                                <p>Pablo is the CEO of Kaleidos/Penpot. He is an entrepreneur with 20+ years of experience in software development. His expertise covers open source,

                            <p>Pablo is an open source hacktivist since 1997. Whether it is contributing with code, time or financial support, he has been actively supporting and 
                                promoting free & open source technology and communities. He finally became an open source entrepreneur and has raised so far $22M for his projects. 
                                His academic background in Physics and Computer Science stands behind his public promotion of critical thinking and civil rights.</p>
                            <p>In 1999, before even Creative Commons existed, he co-founded Alqua, the first open-sourced science library of university textbooks. Bringing open <source>
                            collaboration and inclusive ethos to many other aspects of his life has been a constant.</p>
                              <p>He is proud of being a JRR Tolkien nerd, a traditional archery geek and a role-playing connaiseur. He loves taking care of his garden and spending much
                                time in the kitchen, often improvising delicious meals for Angela to enjoy.</p>
                              <p>He reads about fiction (mostly fantasy and science-fiction) and non-fiction (mostly history and philosophy). He dreams of building his 
                                own astronomical observation dome and discovering some new and exciting stellar object.</p>
